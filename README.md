# Movie-Recommendation-Machine
After browsing through some interesting datasets on Kaggle, we decided to make a personalized movie recommendation for both movie lovers and movie makers using five different movie datasets. We would merge the datasets in one database, perform exploratory data analysis, visualize the historical patterns and trends, run machine learning models for predictive analysis and develop two recommendation machines.

The proposal of the idea of the machine is in the Proposal ppt, the code to realize the machine is in the code file and the report containing all the results is in the report file. All the datasets used are from Kaggle website including:
